	<p>The object of
		<em>The Price is Right Instant Win</em> is to reveal all the symbols on the base game. The base game is made up of four games;
		two rows in Game 1 and two rows in Game 2.</p>
	<p>In Game 1; if all three revealed prizes match then that prize is won.</p>
	<p>In Game 2; if any of the Your Symbols matches the Winning Symbol in that row then the at-tached prize is won.</p>
	<p>During the base game bonus icons can be revealed. If the Cliff Hangers meter is completed by revealing 3 icons then the
		player will be playing Cliff Hangers upon completing the base game. If the Showcase Showdown icon is revealed then the
		player will be taken to play Showcase Showdown at the end of the game.</p>
	<p>In Cliff Hangers; the spinning reel of numbers is stopped when the attached button is pressed. The Yodeller will climb this
		number of stops up the mountain. If he stops in a prize section that prize value is won. The reel starts spinning again
		and continues to be stopped until the Yodeller either stops at the top of the mountain or falls off it. All wins collected
		dur-ing the climb are totalled up and awarded to the player.</p>
	<p>In Showcase Showdown the Big Wheel is covered in multipliers. The wheel is spun and whichever multiplier it lands on is
		applied to the total win.</p>
